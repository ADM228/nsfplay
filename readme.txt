== This is a fork of NSFPlay's source code. It: == 
- Allows native file loading on Linux
- Adds triggering waves for NES triangle and (untested) FDS and N163 wavetables (the only way to access them is thru the nsf2wav executable).
- Improves the nsf2wav executable:
  - Added automatic loop detection, can be overridden with --length-force
  - Added muting and masking of channels
  - Added access to the aforementioned trigger waves

The original Win32 GUI is not touched at all, as I can't be bothered lmao

I (alexmush) will try to update it together with the original repository, as it is far from dead. Features can be suggested and may get added as I continue to improve this software.
